        <p class="paragraph1">Greetings, my name is Ira Ruffin Jr. I am a sophomore at Oakland City University and I am a Computer Science major. I also participate in athletics, IT, and Student Government. My hobbies include making music, playing videogames, and playing football.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">One of my favorite hobbies is making music. One of the reasons why I enjoy making music is because I don't make traditional music such as pop, rock, or rap. The music I make falls under "EDM" which are dubstep, riddim dubstep, future bass, and house music. Genres like EDM intended for music festivals, raves, and clubs. I enjoy making these genres because I get to be creative in a nontraditional fashion.</p>
